# CS330-Comp-Graphics-and-Visualization

#How do I approach designing software?
# By working on this project, I've learned how to create Vertex Array Objects, texture objects, apply light on objects and scenes, learned about different types of light in a scene and learned how to navigate a scene with a camera.
# For my project work, I created it, step by step, adding one feature each time as the semester progressed.  For example, first texture, then light.  Although I did have trouble
adding light.
# In future work, I could use what I learned to make more computer graphics OpenGL programs or other animations or programs in general. 

#How do I approach developing programs?
# By using graphing paper I can easily model out and sketch what I will be making in my 3D scene.  It also allows me to visualize the model better in 3D in terms of vertices.
# Iterations factor affected the zoom, rotations and other factors in my program.  I'm glad I had the oppurtunity to learn about this.  It greatly can benefit a programmer.
# My code evolved throughout the milestones into a completed project with a plane and a complex building. Each milestone was a stepping stone to create the final project teaching us a valuable tool.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#At this point I'm not sure how computer graphics can help me in reaching my goals of working in bioinformatics but I will figure it out.  Maybe I can apply some of the skills learned in creating visualizations and programs into the bioinformatics field.

Thanks for reading my readme.md file and checking out my program.
Best,
